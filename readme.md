## Intro

Since the release of Next 9.3 it is now possible to render dynamic pages at build time. This is perfectly suited for creating a blog and comes with the additional benefit of zeit's super easy deployment platform.

Before refactoring my personal blog, I decided to create a minimal example as a starter.

#### Example

https://nextjs-blog-starter-seven.now.sh

#### Add Post

To add a post simply add a new file to `./src/posts`

#### Deploying

Run `npx now deploy`
